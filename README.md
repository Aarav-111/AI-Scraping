**This is a Code to scrape AI responses**
So, you provide the query (e.g., "What's the capital of France?"), then it goes to ChatGPT.com and pastes the prompt. As soon as ChatGPT generates the response, our code copies it and prints it in Python.

**Version 1**
Our version 1 copies the response

**Version 2**
Our version 2 also prints the response

**Version 3**
Our Version 3 opens adds system instructions

**Version 4**
Our version 4 adds prompt history & key bug fixes

**Version 5**
Version 5 will open & get ChatGPT responses in the Background

**Version 5.1 & 5.5**
Our versions (s) 5.1 & 5.5 are bug fixes for Version 5

**When to use 5.1 & 5.5**

5.1: 5.1 fixes all bugs in 5, but does not include a continuous chat. You'll have to re-run it to use it again

5.5: 5.5 includes a continuous Chat, so you don't have to re-run the code to use it again
